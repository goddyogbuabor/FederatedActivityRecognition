This project contain 5 files.

The “Readme.mb” file is for instructions on how to run the project.

The "FeatureExtraction.ipynb" is used for feature extraction. To train algorithm, features needs to be extracted from the raw sensor data. Use this file to extract feature from each of the dataset. 

The "GlobalTrain.ipynb" is used for global model training. Different machine learning algorithms were trained using “Globaltrain” dataset. 

The "UseCase1.ipynb" is used for the first  scenario where the participants were grouped into four. The corresponding dataset is “UseCase1”. 

The "UseCase2.ipynb" is used for the second  scenario where  each participants  is regarded as a client. The corresponding dataset is “UseCase2”. 

For each experiment, import the corresponding dataset, the globaltrain dataset and the TestData. Change the directory to suit you and run “FeatureExtraction.ipynb” firs to extract features. The extracted features are then used as input vector for the algorithms training.
